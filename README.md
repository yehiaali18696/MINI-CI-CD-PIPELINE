# Mini CI/CD Pipeline - Graduation Project

This is my graduation project where I apply the fundamentals of DevOps by building a mini CI/CD pipeline using different tools.

## Project Components
- Git & GitHub: Version control and source code management.
- Docker: Building and running containers.
- Ansible: Configuration management and automation.
- CI/CD Concepts: Understanding Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to integrate all these components into a single pipeline, so that whenever new code is pushed, it goes through the stages: build → test → deploy.
